# Create a Space

### **Connect your wallet**

Go to [https://www.zesty.market/](https://www.zesty.market) and click on **Launch App**.

Before doing anything, you will need to switch to the Polygon Network in your wallet. If you are using MetaMask, the network selection menu will look like this:

If Polygon (or Matic) is not in your Network list, you will either need to [manually add the RPC](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/network-details/network/) or connect to a Polygon based dApp like [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap) which will automate the process for you.

### **Create a space**

Once you're connected, click on **Spaces** to create your campaign.

Click on **Create Space** on your Spaces page.

You'll be sent to the **Create A Space NFT** page. This is where you can fill in your Space details, including name, image and link. Each Space is an NFT and the details are the metadata attached to the NFT.

When the transaction is completed, you'll receive a notification from MetaMask. You may check on your Space by going to the Space page. If the Space is listed, you're done creating your Space NFT!

## **Deposit**

**Depositing your Space NFT to Zesty's smart contract is required in order to create an auction.**

In the Space page, you'll find **Deposit NFT** button, click on it.

A deposit NFT pop-up will appear. There are 2 actions you are required to do here, **Approve** and **Deposit**. You'll need to do each of the action one-by-one. Both of the buttons will result in MetaMask pop-ups requiring you to confirm your actions.
