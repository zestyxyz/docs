In the tab menu, find `Zesty` in the `Objects` section

#### Configure App

**Step 1**

Enter your `Space` number

**Step 2**

Make sure `network` is set to Polygon unless you are testing

**Step 3**

Set the scale of the image to correspond with your space's format. For reference, the aspect ratios on each format are:

- Tall - 3:4
- Wide - 4:1
- Square - 1:1

**Step 4**

If applicable, choose the `Style` of your banner. `Height` will make scale the banner to be larger or smaller while maintaining the same aspect ratio

**Step 5**

Decide whether or not you want to enable the banner as a `Beacon`, which will opt you into Zesty's Analytics.
