Add the Banner prefab and configure the space ID, format, and style based on your space details from the Zesty marketplace.

To opt into enabling a beacon on your space, simply check the "Enable Beacon" box on the zesty-banner component. This will allow you to see analytics like space visits and banner clicks within the Zesty app.
