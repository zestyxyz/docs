# Refunds

You can get refunds on either **bids you want to cancel** or **Space owners failing to display banner**

If you'd like to cancel a bid that you've placed, you can do so through the **Auctions** tab on either the billboard you're bidding on or the **Active Bids** tab on your Campaign's page.

:::caution
Canceling a bid will require an on-chain transaction

## Refund for Failure to Display Ad

If you can prove that your ad was not successfully displayed during your timeslot, Speak to a team member in [Discord](https://discord.gg/4Jc3XhM5mp) about the situation.

If we are able to refund your USDC, there will be a small fee taken to discourage malicious advertisers from taking advantage of the system.

:::note 
We're working on an automated refund solution. Check out our [Litepaper](../../about/litepaper#zesty-market-protocol) for details on a decentralized validation
